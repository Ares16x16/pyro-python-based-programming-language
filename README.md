# Pyro (Ver2)
Pyro is a self-made programming language using Python. It's just for fun and for practising.<br>
Only a few features are supported currently.<br>
More features will be added in the future. (Maybe) <br>

#### Assigning variable (INT)
Syntax: Either ```INT x``` or ```x = 5``` can be used.
Actaully ```INT x``` has no effects.
#### Printing value of variable
Syntax: ```PRINT x```
The value of the variable will be printed.
Now only support one printing statement.
## Example Code: test.pyro
The following code is used in the test.pyro, which gives the result of ```2```
```
INT 6
6 = 5
6 = 2
PRINT 6
```
